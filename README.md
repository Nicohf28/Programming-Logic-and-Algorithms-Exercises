# Programming Logic and Algorithms Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises I've developed to strengthen my programming logic and algorithmic thinking. Each script addresses a basic programming concept and helps build problem-solving skills.

## Structure

Each file is a self-contained Python script focused on a specific problem or logic exercise.

- `EvenOrOdd.py`: A program that determines whether an input number is even or odd. It includes input validation and the option to try again.

## Getting Started

To run any of the exercises, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, in your terminal:

```bash
python EvenOrOdd.py
